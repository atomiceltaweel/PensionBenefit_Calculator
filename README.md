# PensionBenefit_Calculator

This project is to calculate the pension benefit of retirees, TVs, and active employees, with their data sets about age, annnual pay, service year, 2014 static mortality table, 2018 mortality improvement rate, and so on.

I develop generational mortality table, from 2014 static mortality table and 2018 mortality improvement rate, by generational approac. 
I use 2 actuarial methods, PUC(Projected Unit Credit) and TUC(Traditional Unit Credit), to develop financial accounting and funding requirements.

Based on that, I design a function to calculate their present value of pension benefit. As long as I have all required information/data about the employee, I can calculate his/her PVB(Present Value of Pension Benefit) in a second, which achieves automation.
